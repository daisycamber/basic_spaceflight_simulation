This is a basic demonstration of software for space exploration and technology therefor.

Controls:
- arrow keys = camera
- point ship = qweasd
- fire thrusters = space

In the near future I intend to optimize this code with more exact specifications in
order to demonstrate the technology necessary for simple spaceflight and to provide
outreach for students interested in teaching themselves about space exploration. I
released a basic version of the code so people can tweak it themselves and enjoy
experimenting with what I have written.
